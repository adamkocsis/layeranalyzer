Description: Time series analysis tool using linear layered SDEs. Allows
 for multiple time series with correlative or causal links between them.
 In case of causal feedback loops, the matrix operations (including 
 eigenvalue decompositions) allows for complex numbers. In this case,
 cyclic behavior can be expected.
